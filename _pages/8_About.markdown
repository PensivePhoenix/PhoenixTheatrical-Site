Bryce Bienz is a junior at Point Park University in Pittsburgh, where they are studying Theatrical Production with a concentration in Technical Design and Management. Originally from Wyoming, Bryce’s career in theater began at a young age, hauling audio equipment for family music performances and community events. In high school, they expanded their interests by working with the drama department as a sound designer and mix engineer for musicals.

At the Pittsburgh Playhouse, Bryce has contributed to the audio design and operation for productions like *Little Children Dream of God*, *Spring Awakening*, *Cinderella*, *Closer Than Ever*, and *RENT*. They’ve also worked as a freelance Lighting Designer for dance performances, including shows for Laramie Dance Studio B.

Bryce’s technical expertise spans lights, audio, and AV systems. They are passionate about finding creative solutions to technical challenges, with a particular interest in making systems communicate in new and innovative ways. Their quick learning and hands-on problem-solving skills have been showcased in projects for example; programming the Watchout media server for *Billy Strayhorn: Something to Live For* at Pittsburgh Public Theater, where they took over the programming after only one day of shadowing.

When not immersed in tech, Bryce enjoys outdoor activities like hiking, swimming, biking, and climbing.

Bryce is currently working as a freelance lighting designer/programmer, mix engineer, and video programmer and is always interested in a challenge. Please reach out to <a href="mailto:bryce.bienz@phoenixtheatrical.com">bryce.bienz@phoenixtheatrical.com</a> to connect!
